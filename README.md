## Description
In this project, we built AI agents for the paper and pencil game 'SOS'.
We used search algorithms as: Alpha-Beta Pruning, Minimax and Expectimax
with different heuristics, and compared their performances to find the 
optimal agent (furthor details in AI final project subnittion.pdf).

## SOS Gameplay
This game is similar to tic-tac-toe, but has greater complexity.
There are two players against each other, which can place "S" or "O"
on the board. The winner is the player who has the greater number 
of "SOS" sequences either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
If a player succeeds to create SOS sequence, he gets another turn.
In case both players has the same number of "SOS" sequences, it's a draw. 
The board size is nXn, of any n>=3.
